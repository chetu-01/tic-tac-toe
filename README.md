# tic-tac-toe
The Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Java Swing is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces on a 3 x 3 grid. The objective of the game is to get three of your marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before your opponent does. The game provides two modes of game play : User to User and User to Bot.
